### Service

The *Services* content type is used to display information about a service and the sub-services you offer. It includes a title, summary, body, quote and sub-services.

**Title:** The title is used as the main page title and foundation for the service's address.

**Summary:** The summary is a one or two sentence description of what the service offers. This is primarily used by search engines which are indexing the site.

**Body:** The body is a richly editable region where you can add images, links and text. This makes up the main content for the page.

**Quote:** The quote is an highlighted piece of text which does not need to appear in the content. It will be placed above or beside the page's content prominently.

**Sub-services:** Sub-services include a title and body. The title will be used as a click-able header which will reveal the body content below it. The body is an editable region which includes all the editing capabilities of the main service body.

In addition to the fields above, the *Service* also supports [published status](#publishing), [meta tags](#taxonomies) and being added to a [menu](#menu-items).
