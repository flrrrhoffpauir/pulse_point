### Webform

The *Webform* content type is used to create forms such as the [Contact Us](http://pulsepointgroup.com/contact-us) form. It includes a title, body and can have many fields added to it. Creating a form is a three step processes:

1. Create the form
2. Add elements to the form
3. Set final form settings

**Title:** The title is used as the main page title and foundation for the page's address.

**Body:**  The body is a richly editable region where you can add images, links and text. This makes up the introductory content for the page.

**Additional Fields:** The addition webform fields are available under the "Webform" tab. You can set the order, if they are required, edit them or add additional fields from this page. For more details see [Editing a Webform](#editing-a-webform). 

In addition to the fields above, the *Webform* also supports [published status](#publishing), [meta tags](#metatags) and being added to a [menu](#menu-items).
