### Tool Tip

The *Tool Tip* content type is used to display information on the [Social Media Accelerator](http://pulsepointgroup.com/services/social-media-accelerator). It includes a title, body and weight.

**Title:** The title is used as a header for it's section and will reveal the body content when clicked or hovered over.

**Body:** The body is a editable region where you can add multiple lines of text. The length of this text should be monitored as the font is large and may take up much of the screen space.

**Weight:** The weight is used to set the order of all sub-services. The lower the weight, even negative, the earlier the content will appear on the page.
