### Location

The *Location* content type is used to list out an office location on the contact page. It includes a title, phone number, short address and full address.

**Title:** The title is displayed above the map and address. This is displayed in a large font size, so keeping it short will help with readability.

**Phone Number:** The phone number is displayed verbatim on the contact page. The recommended format is decimal separated, i.e. 123.456.7890. This is a free form field and you do have the flexibility to enter details in a different format.

**Short Address:** The short address is used to get the map from [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com). It is recommended that you use enter your address on Google Maps, and once you have the correct location, to use the exact same address search in this field.

**Address:** The address is displayed under the map. This is not used for creating the locations map so extra information is permitted, for example 'Third floor'.
