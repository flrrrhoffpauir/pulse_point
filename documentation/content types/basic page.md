### Basic Page

The *Basic Page* content type is used for static content pages such an about page. It includes a title, an area for written content and an area for a short description.

**Title:** The title is used as the main page title and foundation for the page's address.

**Body:** The body is a richly editable region where you can add images, links and text. This makes up the main content for the page.

**Summary:** The summary is a one or two sentence description of what the page is about. This is primarily used by search engines which are indexing the site.

In addition to the fields above, the *Basic Page* also supports [published status](#publishing), [meta tags](#metatags) and being added to a [menu](#menu-items).
