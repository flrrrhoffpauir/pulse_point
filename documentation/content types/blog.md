### Blog

The *Blog* content type is used in the [Blog](#), [Pulse Points](#), and [Accelerator Articles](#) sections. It includes a title, summary, body and thumbnail and can also be [tagged](#taxonomies) to help users locate other relevant content.

**Title:** The title is used as the main page title and foundation of the page's address. This is also used above the blog on most listing pages where many blog entries will appear.

**Summary:** The summary is a short introduction to the article. This is used on blog listing pages and for [SEO](#seo) purposes.

**Body:** The body is a richly editable region where you can add images, links and text. This makes up the main content for the blog. The body should not include the blog summary as the summary is automatically added to the page.

**Thumbnail:** The thumbnail is a featured image that is used throughout the site to attract the users attention and interest. This should be 780x440 pixels. Upload JPEGS at 100%, the CMS will compress them. When adding a PNG, pre-compress it as much as possible before uploading. We recommend [ImageOptim](http://imageoptim.com/)

**Tag:** The tags are used to link related information together. You can add multiple tags by holding control or command and clicking on them. For more information on managing tags, look at [taxonomies](#taxonomies). The "Blog" uses the Post Tags taxonomy.

**Pulse Points:** Selecting "Pulse Points" will move the post off of the blog page and onto the Pulse Points page.

**Accelerator:** Selecting "Accelerator" will add the post to the Accelerator articles page.

In addition to the fields above, the *Blog* also supports [published status](#publishing), [meta tags](#metatags) and being added to a [menu](#menu-items).
