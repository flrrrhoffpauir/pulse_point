### Carousel Slide

The *Carousel Slide* content type is used to add new slides to the carousel which appears on the home page. It includes a title, subtitle, main and mobile image, style and link.

**Title:** The title is displayed on the carousel slide in a large dominant font.

**Subtitle:** The subtitle is displayed on the slide in smaller font.

**Slide Image:** The slide image is the image used on most tablets and desktops. It should be 2500x703 pixels large.

**Mobile Image:** The mobile image is the image used on smaller tablets and mobile devices. It should be 610x360 pixels large.

**Style:** Style is used to ensure the text is readable. If your images are primarily dark, you will want to select the dark style as this will make the text light. If your images are lighter, leaving this at the default light style will make the text dark.

**Link:** If you would like the slide to link to another page or site, enter the address into this field. Please ensure that the address of an external website is prefixed with http://, i.e. http://google.com, not google.com.
