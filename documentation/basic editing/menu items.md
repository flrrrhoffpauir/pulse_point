### Menu Items

Adding content to the menu is easily done though the "Menu Settings" tab. After checking "Provide a menu link", more options are made available to you. "Menu link title" is the name of the menu as it appears to users of the site. This should typically match the title of the content, but small deviations are relatively common for example an *About Us* page might have an *About* menu item. The "Description" is used on the administrative backend to help distinguish this menu item. If you have several menus that are similar this can be used to differentiate them. "Parent Item" selects where you would like the menu item to appear. Selecting "\<Main menu\>" for example would place the menu as a root menu item where as selecting *\-\- About* would place the new menu as a child menu underneath the *About* menu. You can manually set the "weight" of the menu to change the order however changing this on the menu edit page is usually much more intuitive. See [menus](#menus) if you would like more information on this.
