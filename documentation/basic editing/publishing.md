### Publishing

At the bottom of the edit page is the *Publishing Options* tab. This contains three options that can make a big difference on how your content is presented.

**Published:** The "Published"* options sets whether that content is available for users. If content is not published, it will not be visible to non-authenticated users. Authenticated users are able to see and edit unpublished content as well as change the published status.

**Promoted to Front Page:** The "Promoted to Front Page" option is used on some content types such as *blogs* to include the content on the front page of the site.

**Sticky at Top of Lists:** Making content sticky will position some content earlier in the listing, being promoted out of the normal order.
