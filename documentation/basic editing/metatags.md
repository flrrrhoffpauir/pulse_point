### Meta Tags

The "Meta tags" tab includes options which can be used to specify information primarily for [SEO](#seo). The most common fields are "Page title" and "Description". "Page title" is used as the title of the browser tab and appears in some search engine listings. The "Description" is a short summary of what the content of the page is about. The description will often appear underneath the title on a search engine result. By default, these fields are automatically pulling content from the page but they can be manually overridden with any text you like.

Other options are available in the "Open Graph" and "Advanced" tabs.
