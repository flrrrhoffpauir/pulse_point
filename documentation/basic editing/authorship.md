### Authorship

All content on the site operates under the idea of authorship. This provides two features, special permissions and attribution. The author of content is allowed to edit, delete and assign authorship of their content. The change of authorship is especially useful when working in conjunction with attribution.

The author of content is attributed visually on the site, typically with a circular image beside a blog post. This allows users to easily access the author's bio and other content.

To change the authorship of content, go to the edit screen for the content. At the bottom of the page under "Authoring Information", change "Authored by" to the appropriate user. After selecting the author, click "Save".
