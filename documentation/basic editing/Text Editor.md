1. **Bold:** Bolding text makes it darker and more prominent without increasing it's size. If you are trying to make text that functions as a heading, it is best to use the "Format" drop down. 
2. **Italic** 
3. **Underline** 
4. **Strike Through**
5. **Bulleted List**

The WYSIWYG editor works very similar to a desktop text processor such as Microsoft Word, however there are several things to be careful of. The most common issue people have when working with online text processors are incorrect formatting. This usually happens when content is first produced in Word, then copied and pasted into the editor. If you are using this workflow, you must paste in the content using the Paste From Word (12th item in the list above). This will help remove non-standard information that is embedded into the content by Word. In general it is recommended that all formatting is done on the website as this will make sure that the content is properly formatted on all devices. 

By default when you press "enter" it will create a new paragraph. If you want to change the type of text, you will want to use the "format" drop down and select another style such as Heading 3. To create a new line of text without making a new paragraph, hold down "shift" while pressing "enter".
