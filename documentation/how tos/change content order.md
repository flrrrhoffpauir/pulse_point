### How to change content order

Most content is ordered using its created date. To change content's order simply:

1. click "Edit" on the content you would like to change
2. at the bottom of the edit page select "Authorinig Information"
3. set "Authored on" to a value that orders you content as desired
4. click "Save"

Some content is ordered using "weight". Weight is represented in two ways, as a clickable move icon which can be dragged to reorder or as a text field with a number. The higher the weight of content is, the heavier it is, and the lower it will sink on the page. Conversely, the lower the weight, even if negative, the lighter it is and the higher it will float on the page.
