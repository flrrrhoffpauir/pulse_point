### How to upload a file

Uploading a file works very similarly to uploading an image.

While you are editing your content:

1. click the "Link" button
2. click "Browse Server"
3. click "Upload" in the top left corner
4. browse your computer and select the file you want to upload
5. click "Upload" and wait
6. select the file on the right pane
7. click "Insert file"
8. click "OK"

To add a file outside of content editing:

1. Sign in
2. Look for the "File Browser" tab on your user home page.
3. Use the left panel to locate the folder where you want to add the file.
4. Follow the steps from above, starting with #3.
