### How to place blog articles in the different sections

Blogs can be placed on the blog page, with the Pulse Points or the Accelerator Articles. To put the blog on the Pulse Points or Accelerator Articles list, select those options at the bottom of the blog edit page. If you would like to have the blog only appear on one of the specialty pages select "Hide From Blog" on the blog edit page.
