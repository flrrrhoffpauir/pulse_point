### How to add a new employee

Adding an employee is a two step process, creating a new user and setting the employee information.

To add a new user:

1. sign into the site
1. navigate to the admin menu
2. hover over "People"
3. select "Add user"
4. fill out form
4. Upload a headshot in the thumbnail field. This should be sized to 460 x 460 pixels. Upload JPEGS at 100%, the CMS will compress them.
5. click create new account

When creating the new user, ensure that the "Employee" checkbox is checked and that a first name and thumbnail are provided at a minimum. To update an employee's information:

1. sign into the site
2. navigate to the main menu
3. click "People"
4. click on the "edit" link on the same row as the user you would like to edit.
5. make the updates
6. click "Save"
