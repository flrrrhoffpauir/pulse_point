### How to clear cache after changes, if needed

1. sign into the site
2. navigate to the admin menu
3. hover over the home icon
4. hover over "Flush all caches"
5. click "Page and else"

After the page reloads your page will be rebuild. If you still have issues, click "Flush all caches" instead of clicking "Page and else" to perform a complete cache clear.
