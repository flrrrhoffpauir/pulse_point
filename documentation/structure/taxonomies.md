### Taxonomies

*Taxonomies* are a system of organizing content. Taxonomies in Drupal are represented as a named group of terms. An example of this would be a taxonomy named Colours with terms red, green and blue. Taxonomies can be managed by going to the main admin menu, selecting "Structure" and then selecting "Taxonomies". Clicking on "list terms" allows you to see all available terms for that particular taxonomy as well as the ability to add additional terms.
