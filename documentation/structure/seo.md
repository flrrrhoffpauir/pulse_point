### SEO

Search Engine Optimization, SEO, is the process of making your website's content understandable to a search engine with the goal of improving your ranking for relevant searches. Your site has been setup to with many SEO features that work automatically behind the scenes to make sure a search engine is able to understand your content easily. In addition to the automatic SEO features, there are several options that you have control over. They are the title, summary and meta tags. 

The title of your page is one of the most important tools for indicating what your content is about to a search engine. It should be short but relevant to the content of the page. 

A summary is available on some of the content types on the site. The summary is often used on the listing pages to give a teaser of the full content of the page. The summary also performs a secondary function. It is by default used by search engines to provide searchers with a short introduction to the pages.

Meta tags are used by search engines and other services to find out information about the page. This is useful for providing details like author, featured images and page description. Meta tags have a value set by default, but you can override these settings on a per content basis. See the [meta tags](#meta-tags) section for more information.

As a general tip, it is never better to optimize for search engines at the expense of providing relevant content to users. Search engines are constantly improving their ability to detect content that is over optimized and there is a chance that these practices could result in a reduction of your ranking.
